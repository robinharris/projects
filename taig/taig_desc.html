                Before purchasing a lathe, my experience of metalwork extended to two years at school in which time I made a hammer. &#128580

                My lathe is a Taig Microlathe II puchased second-hand for around Â£300, complete with motor and baseplate and a few tools

                The motor that came with the lathe was a 1/4hp AC but this photo shows the latest arrangement.  The motor has been replaced with a sewing maching motor and a new baseplate used.
                This one is a heavy piece of oak kitchen worktop faced with 2mm steel plate.
            </p>
            <p>
                The motor is a type of stepper motor and its controller provides variable speed from around 100rpm to 2500rpm.
                It comes with a pedal speed controller, as used with sewing machines, based around a magnet and a Hall Effect sensor.
                Two problems quickly emerge though - a magnet attracts swarf and speed control is coarse.

                However, the sensor provides a variable voltage output and can easily be replaced with a potentiometer.
            </p>
            <p>
                The values shown (left) are partly calculated and partly trial and error, designed to give the smoothest divner response.
                Using a reverse logarithmic potentiometer significantly helped in this respect.
            </p>
            <p>
                Originally the Taig used stepped pulleys providing quite a wide speed range but requires moving the belt.
                With a variable speed motor this is obviosuly not required.  GT2 pulley wheels and 3mm belt was tried first because 
                it was cheap - it worked for a short while but the belt soon broke.  The second version uses a poly V-belt and pulleys which have worked perfectly.

                The speed controller incorporates an run / stop switch so that the speed control can be set and left.  It floats on a length of cable so that it can 
                be positioned as required.

                This motor and drive arrangement is very quiet and has improved the useability of the lathe greatly.

            After months trying to get an acceptable surface finish the final option was to buy a new bed because the original had worn and would not adjust sufficiently to eliminate chatter.
            Almost immediately results improved dramatically and at last material was being cut smoothly.  A couple of examples are shown below.

        Using the lathe has been both rewarding and intensely frustrating - rewarding when a part is produced to size and is shiny!
        Frustrating when steps cannot be reproduced consitently.  Here are some of the things that have troubled me and how I have overcome them:
