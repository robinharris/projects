            Before purchasing a lathe, my experience of metalwork extended to two years at school in which time I made a hammer. &#128580
        </p>
    
        <p>
            My lathe is a Taig Microlathe II puchased second-hand for around Â£300 and complete with motor and baseplate..

            Tthe motor that came with the lathe was a 1/4hp AC but this photo shows the latest arrangement.  The motor has been replaced with a sewing maching motor and a new baseplate used.
            This one is a heavy piece of oak kitchen worktop faced with 2mm steel plate.

        <p>
            The motor is a type of stepper motor and its controller provides variable speed from around 100rpm to 2500rpm.
            It comes with a pedal speed controller, as used with sewing machines, based around a magnet and a Hall Effect sensor.
            Two problems quickly emerge though - a magnet around a lathe attracts swarf and the precision is poor. 

            The sensor provides a variable voltage output and can easily be replaced with a potentiometer.

            The values used are partly calculated and partly trial and error designed to give the smoothest liner response
            to the rotation of the potentiometer.  Using s reverse logarithmic potentiometer significantly helped in this respect.
